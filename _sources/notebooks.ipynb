Ia saat ini menjalani karier sebagai seorang gravure dan cosplayer.Mungkin masih asing di telinga terkait profesi gravure. Tapi di dunia permodelan Jepang sangat beken dengan nama ini, meski kerap disalahartikan oleh kebanyakan orang.Kepada detikcom, Rie Airie mulai jadi cosplayer sejak 2012. Lalu ia mencoba menjadi gravure di 2018.\\r\\n    \\r\\n  \\r\\n        \\r\\n  Tak jarang Airie menerima banyak hujatan dan tatapan sinis dari sekitar. Padahal, kariernya ini bermula ditekuni lantaran ingin bangun kepercayaan diri.\"Gravure ini lebih seperti majalah yang menampilkan model cantik yang berumur 17-30 tahun. Di Jepang modelnya itu disebut gravure idol, kalau di sini model saja,\" tutur Airie.\"Awalnya aku buat ngebangun kepercayaan diri, karena waktu itu cosplay gravure lagi lumayan trending. Jadi coba ke situ dan ternyata responsnya lumayan positif,\" sambungnya.Airie pun tak mengelak bahwa dengan kostum ala anime dan berlenggak bak model jelas menimbulkan stigma negatif bagi yang tak menyukai dirinya.Di sisi lain, para penikmat budaya Jepang juga rupanya masih membawa kesulitan untuknya. Sebab, publik kerap mengkomparasi Airie dengan yang lain.\"Paling utama itu stigma publik sama kadang ada saja yang membanding-bandingkan atau standar kecantikan yang sangat variatif,\" ujar Airie.\"Jadi kalau tidak terpenuhi ada saja yang rese. Cuma ya aku mencoba untuk nggak terlalu mempermasalahkan saja sih, nggak ngehasilin apa-apa juga kalau aku balas,\" lanjutnya.Kendati suka dipandang negatif, Airie terbilang membatasi lingkungan kerjanya. Ia bahkan menolak jika harus bekerja sama dengan orang yang tidak ia percayai, termasuk fotografer.Sebab menjadi cosplay gravure begitu menantang. Demi tampil maksimal, Airie tak rela mengeluarkan kocek untuk sewa kamar hotel.\"Kalau aku buat konten cosplay gravure yang memang nyewa studio atau kamar hotel sekaligus fotografer, orangnya itu memang sudah aku kenal lama dan ikut andil juga dalam cosplay gravure ini,\" katanya.  \n","0    Memilih terjun sebagai seorang cosplayer tak s...

mungkin dirasakan sosok Rie Airie. Ia saat ini menjalani karier sebagai seorang gravure dan cosplayer.Mungkin masih asing di telinga terkait profesi gravure. Tapi di dunia permodelan Jepang sangat beken dengan nama ini, meski kerap disalahartikan oleh kebanyakan orang.Kepada detikcom, Rie Airie mulai jadi cosplayer sejak 2012. Lalu ia mencoba menjadi gravure di 2018.\\r\\n    \\r\\n  \\r\\n        \\r\\n  Tak jarang Airie menerima banyak hujatan dan tatapan sinis dari sekitar. Padahal, kariernya ini bermula ditekuni lantaran ingin bangun kepercayaan diri.\"Gravure ini lebih seperti majalah yang menampilkan model cantik yang berumur 17-30 tahun. Di Jepang modelnya itu disebut gravure idol, kalau di sini model saja,\" tutur Airie.\"Awalnya aku buat ngebangun kepercayaan diri, karena waktu itu cosplay gravure lagi lumayan trending. Jadi coba ke situ dan ternyata responsnya lumayan positif,\" sambungnya.Airie pun tak mengelak bahwa dengan kostum ala anime dan berlenggak bak model jelas menimbulkan stigma negatif bagi yang tak menyukai dirinya.Di sisi lain, para penikmat budaya Jepang juga rupanya masih membawa kesulitan untuknya. Sebab, publik kerap mengkomparasi Airie dengan yang lain.\"Paling utama itu stigma publik sama kadang ada saja yang membanding-bandingkan atau standar kecantikan yang sangat variatif,\" ujar Airie.\"Jadi kalau tidak terpenuhi ada saja yang rese. Cuma ya aku mencoba untuk nggak terlalu mempermasalahkan saja sih, nggak ngehasilin apa-apa juga kalau aku balas,\" lanjutnya.Kendati suka dipandang negatif, Airie terbilang membatasi lingkungan kerjanya.

(DBI)\n","\n","Meningkatnya jumlah penduduk menyebabkan kepentingan dan ketergantungan manusia pada lahan pertanian semakin meningkat. Namun, dibeberapa daerah terdapat lahan yang belum terkelompok berdasarkan kriteria lahan pertanian. Oleh karena itu, diperlukan pengelompokan lahan berdasarkan kriteria lahan pertanian. Pengolahan data dengan  pengelompokan (clustering) data yang umum digunakan adalah K-Means clustering, yang termasuk metode partition clustering, yakni mempartisi data kedalam bentuk satu atau lebih kelompok. Untuk memvalidasi data setelah proses clustering digunakan Davies Bouldin Index (DBI) untuk meningkatkan akurasi validasi hasil analisis data. Pada penelitian ini, pengelompokan lahan tanaman pangan pada skenario yang dijadikan tiga cluster dengan 10, 20 dan 30 iterasi diperoleh di iterasi ke-10 kecocokan dengan label asli sebesar 73.61 % pada 72 data lahan tanaman padi.

Salah satu data berskala besar adalah data teks. Data teks memiliki fitur yang sangat besar sehingga untuk mengolahnya memerlukan waktu komputasi yang besar pula. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengurangi waktu komputasi dalam proses clustering sehingga data teks dapat diolah secara efisien. Proses clustering menggunakan metode SOM dengan menerapkan reduksi dimensi pada tahap preprosesing. Metode ini diterapkan untuk mengelompokan data tugas akhir mahasiswa Teknik Informatika Universitas Trunojoyo Madura. Dalam metode yang diusulkan, analisis morfologi dilakukan pada teks abstrak tugas akhir mahasiswa untuk menghasilkan vektor input dengan unsur term dari tugas akhir tersebut. Adanya elemen vektor yang jarang, memungkinkan terjadinya reduksi dimensi. Reduksi dimensi dilakukan dengan  menghilangkan matriks jarang atau kolom yang banyak mengandung nilai 0. Dari percobaan yang dilakukan, diperoleh hasil bahwa optimum cluster untuk data abstrak berada pada scenario 1 yaitu jumlah term setelah direduksi sebanyak 150 term, sehingga menghasilkan nilai rata-rata SSE = 0.01117.  Sedangkan untuk data laporan optimum cluster berada pada scenario 2 yaitu jumlah term setelah direduksi sebanyak 346 term, sehingga mengahasilkan nilai rata-rata SSE = 0.0085 detik.\n","https://pta.trunojoyo.ac.id/welcome/detail/060411100810\n","Penulis : Pan Gani Ginting\n","Pengembangan Aplikasi Pendeteklsi Plagiarisme Dengan Metode Latent Semantik Index\n","Pendeteksian plagiarisme dilakukan untuk mendeteksi plagiarisme  terhadap karya ilmiah .

Pada penelitian ini, kompleksitas visual citra digunakan untuk mengkategorikan citra antara lain Very Simple, Simple, Medium, Complex, dan Very Complex. Kompleksitas visual citra direpresentasikan dengan tiga fitur, diantranya adalah fitur Structure, Noise, dan Diversity. Fitur Structure diekstraksi dengan menghitung rasio antara piksel tepi dengan total jumlah piksel pada citra, tepi dari citra dideteksi dengan tiga deteksi tepi yaitu Sobel, Prewitt dan Laplacian of Gaussian. Fitur Noise diekstraksi dengan menghitung Standard Deviasi dari citra yang dikonvolusi dengan kernel Laplacian. Sedangkan fitur Diversity diekstraksi dengan membagi antara piksel sudut dengan jumlah baris pada citra, sudut dari citra dideteksi menggunakan FAST Algorithm. Sistem Inferensi Fuzzy tipe Mamdani digunakan untuk memberi label pada citra berdasarkan fitur yang sudah diekstraksi. Hasil uji coba menunjukkan bahwa semakin banyak objek dan pola pada citra, maka semakin tinggi pula kompleksitas visual dari citra. Sebaliknya, semakin sedikit objek dan pola pada citra, maka semakin rendah pula kompleksitas visual dari citra.

Di sisi lain, beberapa penelitian menunjukkan bahwa penerapan diskretisasi berbasis entropy sebagai metode preprocessing mampu meningkatkan akurasi klasifikasi data. Karenanya, dibangun sebuah hipotesis bahwa penerapan diskretisasi berbasis entropy juga mampu meningkatkan akurasi klasifikasi data pada kasus diagnosis penyakit liver. Dalam penelitian ini, diskretisasi berbasis entropy diterapkan sebagai metode preprocessing, sedangkan KNN digunakan sebagai metode klasifikasi. Klasifikasi dilakukan terhadap data set awal dan data set yang telah melalui proses diskretisasi berbasis entropy. Kemudian, akurasi yang dihasilkan oleh klasifikasi terhadap data set awal dibandingkan dengan akurasi yang dihasilkan oleh klasifikasi terhadap data set terdiskretisasi. Dari seluruh skenario uji coba yang telah dilakukan, terlihat bahwa akurasi klasifikasi pada data set terdiskretisasi lebih tinggi daripada akurasi klasifikasi pada data set awal.

Pengenalan wajah merupakan bagian dari pattern recognition. Salah satu bentuk penerapan pengenalan wajah ini yaitu membedakan wajah antar satu orang dengan yang lain.Pada penelitian ini akan dibuat sistem pengenalan wajah menggunakan ekstraksi fitur Diagonal Principal Component Analysis (DiaPCA) untuk menentukan karakteristik dari wajah. Setelah itu dilakukan pengukuran kemiripan antara data pelatihan (training) dan data uji coba (testing) menggunakan metode klasifikasi Euclidean Distance. Melalui proses citra wajah ini dapat diketahui identitas dari seseorang. Alasan menggunakan ekstraksi fitur DiaPCA pada tugas akhir ini karena DiaPCA mengubah citra wajah asli menjadi  citra wajah diagonal dengan memadukan informasi dari baris dan kolom pada citra asli untuk menemukan beberapa blok yang berguna atau struktur informasi yang diakui oleh citra asli, misalnya struktur daerah mata, hidung dan lain-lain. Dari ujicoba aplikasi menggunakan klasifikasi Euclidean Distance diperoleh akurasi pengenalan terbaik pada basis data ORL, YALE dan BERN masing-masing 94,16%, 92%, dan 94,06%.

Pada umumnya filesystem yang terdapat di sistem operasi Linux menyimpan data dalam bentuk data asli (plain text) yang aksesnya hanya dibatasi oleh access control. Keamanan data pada filesystem ini dapat ditingkatkan dengan mengimplementasikan enkripsi yang akan secara otomatis mengubah data asli menjadi data acak (cipher text). Proses enkripsi akan menjamin data yang tersimpan hanya dapat dibaca oleh pengguna yang memiliki kunci dekripsi. Dalam penelitian ini telah berhasil dikembangkan suatu filesystem berbasis framework FUSE yang mengenkripsi data menggunakan algoritma Blowfish.\n","Hasil uji coba membuktikan bahwa performa filesystem yang dikembangkan dalam penelitian ini mengalami penurunan performa rata-rata sebesar 37,86% dibandingkan dengan filesystem standar Ext4 yang umum digunakan di Linux.

Pemberian watermark pada citra menggunakan algoritma LSB memiliki konsep sederhana sehingga informasi yang disisipkan akan mudah hilang saat mengalami serangan seperti serangan noise atau kompresi. Sehingga perlu dilakukan modifikasi yaitu pengembangan algoritma LSB. Hal ini dilakukan untuk mengurangi distorsi informasi watermark terhadap serangan yang terjadi. Dalam Tugas Akhir atau TA ini dibagi menjadi 6 proses, yaitu ekstraksi kanal warna citra cover, pencarian area busy, penyisipan watermark, perhitungan akurasi penyisipan, ekstraksi watermark dan perhitungan akurasi ekstraksi. Ekstraksi kanal warna citra cover adalah proses mendapatkan kanal warna biru pada citra cover. Selanjutnya citra watermark disisipkan ke dalam citra cover sehingga menghasilkan citra terwatermark menggunakan algoritma beberapa pengembangan LSB dan mencari akurasinya dengan menghitung nilai Peak Signal to Noise Ratio. Sebelum citra terwatermark diekstraksi, dilakukan pengujian dengan memberi noise dan melakukan kompresi format jpg. Akurasi hasil ekstraksi dicari dengan menghitung nilai Bit Error Rate.\n","https://pta.trunojoyo.ac.id/welcome/detail/090411100087\n","Penulis : AYU WULANDARI\n","PERANCANGAN DAN PEMBUATAN SISTEM PENDUKUNG KEPUTUSAN PENENTUAN PEMBERIAN BEASISWA MENGGUNAKAN METODE FUZZY ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS (FAHP) DAN ORESTE\n","\n","Pada lembaga pendidikan khususnya Universitas banyak sekali menawarkan beasiswa kepada mahasiswa, terutama bagi mahasiswa yang sedang aktif kuliah, beasiswa yang diberikan diantaranya beasiswa PPA dan BBM.

Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk merancang sebuah desain aplikasi untuk mendapatkan sebuah blueprint pada modul distribusi. Zachman Framework (ZF) merupakan salah satu kerangka kerja untuk memetakan artifak sebuah arsitektur informasi dalam sebuah organisasi. ZF mendeskripsikan level perspektif arsitektur IT. Terdiri dari 6 level perspektif yaitu: Scope (Planner Perspective), Enterprise Model (Owner Perspective), System Model (Designer Perspective), Technology Model (Builder Perspective), Detailed Representation (Sub-Contractor/Implementer Perspective) dan Functioning Enterprise (Participant Perspective). Perspektif tersebut sesuai dengan abstraksi objek (what, how, why, when, where, who). Untuk standarisasi artifak informasi digunakan pendekatan UML 2.0, sehingga mampu meningkatkan deskripsi ZF menjadi standart Model Driven Design. Untuk pengujian hasil dari desain perancangan sistem telah dikembangkan perangkat lunak ERP pada modul distribusi yang telah menerapkan konsep Model Driven Design untuk menjadi aplikasi yang berkualitas. Berdasarkan hasil pengujian sistem dari PT.IGLAS persero, didapatkan tingkat kepuasan rata-rata 85.6.

Membaca menjadi salah satu prasyarat memperoleh berbagai ilmu pengetahuan, karena itu membaca harus diajarkan sejak pendidikan anak usia dini. Anak usia dini mencakup umur 2-5 tahun yang masih tergolong sangat belia, dimana anak masih cenderung lebih senang untuk bermain saja. Pendekatan dalam pembelajaran sangat diperlukan sehingga walaupun anak masih dalam usia belia, mereka sudah mampu menyerap pelajaran sedikit demi sedikit. Salah satu pendekatan yang paling menarik saat ini melalui game. Dengan pendekatan ini anak akan senang bermain dan bersemangat untuk belajar.  Model pembelajaran yang akan diterapkan pada penelitian ini yaitu menggunakan metode fonik. Metode fonik adalah model pembelajaran bahasa Indonesia untuk anak usia dini (0-8tahun) berdasarkan pendekatan komunikatif dan tahapan perkembangan anak. Metode fonik mengajarkan pengenalan huruf yang lebih menekankan pada mendengarkan bunyi huruf dan melihat huruf. Terdapat 4 tahap dalam metode fonik, yaitu: tahap prafonik, tahap 1, tahap 2 (Kelas 1 SD), dan tahap 3 (Kelas 2-3 SD). Dalam penelitian ini menggunakan tahap prafonik.

Hama dan penyakit memiliki jenis dan gejala yang berbeda. Untuk jenis hama dan penyakit diantaranya: penggerek batang, hawar daun bakteri, dan lain-lain. sedangkan gejala dari hama maupun penyakit tanaman padi antara lain: adanya ngengat kupu-kupu, anakan berkurang, daun padi berwarna kuning, dan lain-lain. Untuk mempermudah mendiagnosa jenis hama dan penyakit tanaman padi, dibutuhkan adanya sistem pakar yang cara kerjanya hampir sama dengan seorang pakar dalam bidangnya. Gejala-gejala yang terdapat pada sistem sering mengandung ketidakpastian karena fakta yang didapat di lapangan tidak sesuai dengan panduan seorang pakar. Untuk mengatasi masalah ketidakpastian tersebut, sistem pakar mengadopsi metode Certainty Factor untuk menganalisa berdasarkan gejala-gajala yang terdapat pada masalah yang terjadi.

Seiring berkembangnya ilmu pengetahuan dan teknologi sekarang  penulis mencoba untuk membuat suatu perancangan sistem yang dapat mengontrol atau memantau tanaman dengan menggunakan kelembaban tanah sebagai indikator keadaan tanah berbasis jaringan sensor nirkabel menggunakan arduino. Pengukuran kelembaban tanah pada tanaman dilakukan dengan memanfaatkan satu sensor kelembaban tanah ber-tipe YL-69 dan dua sensor ber-tipe FC-28. Nilai yang terukur dari sensor akan diolah oleh mikrokontroler arduino yang terhubung dengan Ethernet Shield. Hasil pengukuran sensor kemudian dikirim melalui jaringan internet yang langsung terhubung dengan database server  dan hasil pengukuran selanjutnya akan di tampilkan melalui web server. Melalui aplikasi web  dapat memberikan informasi secara detail dan akurat. Dengan perancangan dan pengimplementasian sistem monitoring tanaman berbasis jaringan sensor nirkabel pemantuan dan pengolahan tanaman dapat dilakukan secara otomatis dan terkontrol. Hasil pengujian menunjukkan bahwa pengujian saat dilakukan pada ruang outdoor dan indoor berbeda nilai kelembaban tanah pada ruang indoor lebih stabil  dibuktikan dengan menghitung simpangan baku pada tiap tanaman di ruang indoor dan outdoor. Perbedaan nilai simpangan baku tanaman I sebesar 1,33%, pada tanaman II sebesar 0,14%, sedangkan pada tanaman III sebesar 0,15%.\n","\n","Kata kunci: Jaringan Sensor Nirkabel, Web Server, Arduino, Jaringan Internet, Kelembaban Tanah.  \n","\n","https://pta.trunojoyo.ac.id/welcome/detail/110411100011\n","Penulis : Wildan\n","Pengaruh Penggunaan Preprocessing Pada Tingkat Similaritas Dokumen Menggunakan Algoritma Rabin-Karp (Studi Kasus : Abstrak Karya Ilmiah)\n","Plagiasi merupakan penjiplakan atau pengambilan karangan, pendapat dan sebagainya dari orang lain dan menjadikannya seolah karangan dan pendapat sendiri.

CNN terdiri dari lapisan konvolusi, ReLU, Pooling, dan Fully-connected. CNN memiliki 2 jenis output, yaitu binary-class dan multi-class. Penggunaan binary-class kurang efektif dalam mengidentifikasi banyak atribut sekaligus karena memerlukan pelatihan model yang baru untuk mengidentifikasi atribut yang lain. Sedangkan multi-class dapat mengidentifikasi banyak atribut dengan menggunakan sebuah model. Multi-class mempunyai 2 jenis label, yaitu single-label yang menghasilkan satu label pada ouput dan multi-label yang menghasilkan output berupa banyak label.

Deteksi manusia memiliki peranan penting dalam kehidupan sehari hari seperti  sistem keamanan pada tempat umum serta sistem kerja pada self drive car.  Masalah utama dalam deteksi manusia khususnya pejalan kaki yaitu tingkat akurasi serta kecepatan deteksi. Untuk memperoleh tingkat akurasi serta kecepatan deteksi yang maksimal,  banyak hal  yang harus diperhatikan  seperti keberagaman pose pejalan kaki, jarak pejalan kaki yang jauh dari kamera pengawas,  background atau lingkungan disekitar pejalan kaki yang kompleks serta pencahayaan yang berubah ubah. Dalam proses deteksi manusia menggunakan Region Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) terdapat dua tahapan utama yaitu menentukan region proposal dan klasifikasi. Region proposal adalah  kandidat area yang dianggap sebagai manusia. Klasifikasi berguna untuk menentukan region proposal adalah manusia atau objek lain. ekstraksi region proposal dengan sliding window masih memiliki kelemahan yaitu menghasilkan banyak window dan perlu didentifikasikan menggunakan classifier. Pada  penelitian ini, ekstraksi region proposal menggunakan Selective search yang dikombinasikan dengan Region Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) untuk deteksi manusia. Dataset yang digunakan dalam penelitian adalah ini adalah INRIA Person dataset.

Dalam sebuah kompetisi terdapat banyak penghargaan selain tim yang juara, salah satunya adalah pemain terbaik atau sering disebut dengan Most Valuable Player (MVP). Namun dalam menentukan pemain terbaik dalam sebuah kompetisi masih menggunakan cara yang manual atau dengan cara menghitung nilai ranking dari semua pemain yang berkompetisi sehingga sulit bagi panitia kompetisi untuk melakukan pemilihan pemain terbaik, oleh sebab itu diperlukan suatu sistem pendukung keputusan agar panitia dapat lebih cepat dan akurat dalam mentukan siapa yang layak untuk mendapat penghargaan pemain terbaik. Sistem pendukung keputusan ini mengimplementsikan metode geometric mean dan metode TOPSIS (Technique For Others Reference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). Geometric mean digunakan untuk mencari rata-rata dari banyaknya bobot yang diinputkan, TOPSIS lebih banyak digunakan karena kesederhanaannya dalam mersepon kebutuhan pembuat keputusan dan caranya menganalisa respon. Ada beberapa kriteria yang menjadi bahan pertimbangan dalam menentukan pemain terbaik antara lain serve, receive, dig, toss, spike dan block. Pengujian dilakukan dengan cara membandingkan hasil system pendukung keputusan dengan hasil keputusan panitia yang terdiri dari 5 turnamen proliga dari tahun 2015-2019, dengan hasil tingkat akurasi sebesar 60% yang menunjukan bahwa system pendukung keputusan dapat digunakan untuk menentukan pemain terbaik dalam sebuah turnamaen atau kompetisi. \n","Kata kunci: Bola Voli, Sistem Pendukung Keputusan, Geometric Mean, Pemain Terbaik, TOPSIS\n","\n","https://pta.trunojoyo.ac.id/welcome/detail/150411100121\n","Penulis : Wahid Arinanto Nugroho\n","Algoritma Improved Sqrt-Cosine Similarity pada Sistem Temu Kembali Dokumen Penelitian\n","Banyaknya dokumen penelitian yang terkumpul dalam bentuk soft file mengakibatkan proses pencarian secara manual menjadi sulit. Pencarian pada database biasanya hanya mencari judul penelitian yang sesuai dengan kata kunci (keyword) yang diberikan, namun sistem tidak dapat mengukur dokumen yang paling mirip. Sistem temu kembali informasi merupakan salah satu solusi yang dapat membantu dalam mendapatkan informasi yang diinginkan. Dengan menerapkan sistem temu kembali informasi, diharapkan permasalahan pencarian dokumen penelitian dapat memberikan hasil yang relevan dan sesuai dengan kebutuhan pengguna. Salah satu masalah yang telah diselesaikan adalah sistem temu kembali dokumen menggunakan algoritma Cosine Similarity (CS). Perhitungan pada algoritma CS mengacu pada jarak Euclidean. Secara umum jarak Euclidean bukan matrik yang efektif dalam menangani probabilitas, dimana sering digunakan dalam analisis teks. Selain algoritma CS, algoritma lain untuk menghitung kemiripan dokumen adalah algoritma Sqrt-Cosine Similarity (SCS). Namun dalam beberapa kasus, algoritma SCS bertentangan dengan definisi dari pengukuran kemiripan itu sendiri. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode pembobotan TF-IDF dan algoritma yang digunakan untuk menghitung kemiripan antara dokumen dengan keyword adalah algoritma Improved SQRT-Cosine Similarity (ISC). Berdasarkan hasil pengujian yang telah dilakukan, diperoleh kesimpulan bahwa tingkat relevansi suatu dokumen yang dicari pada dasarnya tergantung pada pengguna sendiri. Penggunaan algoritma ISC yang telah diteliti ini sudah dapat mencari dokumen yang dianggap relevan dan sesuai dengan keyword yang diberikan, selisih nilai presisi yang didapatkan antara penggunaan algoritma ISC dan algoritma CS yaitu sebesar 5%. Nilai relevansi yang diperoleh setelah menggunakan algoritma ISC berdasarkan pengujian nilai rata-rata presisi yaitu sebesar 83%.

Penggunaan media sosial saat ini juga menjadi kunci dalam mendatangkan pengunjung website. Oleh karena itu, mengoptimalkan media sosial seperti Twitter terhadap website diperlukan untuk membantu mempromosikan website penjualan batik Madura dalam meningkatkan trafik pengunjung. Agar mempermudah pengarahan trafik pengunjung ke website dari media sosial, maka perlu diterapkan metode Social Media Optimization (SMO). Metode ini diterapkan, diuji dan diukur nilai signifikansinya untuk mengetahui pengaruh trafik pengunjung terhadap website penjualan online batik Madura. Dari hasil pengujian yang telah diterapkan metode SMO, pengunjung yang didapat mengalami peningkatan yang signifikan di bulan kedua. Dilihat berdasarkan uji nilai t menggunakan paired t-test dimana korelasi antara sebelum dan sesudah dioptimasi sebesar 2%, dan t hitung 3.548 > t tabel 1.697 dengan nilai signifikansi 0.001 < alfa 0.05, yang berarti H0 ditolak dan H1 diterima atau hipotesis diterima.

Rekomendasi film adalah aplikasi yang paling populer digunakan ditambah dengan platform multimedia online. Dalam menghasilkan rekomendasi ada beberapa pendekatan metode tradisional yaitu metode Collaborative Filtering(CF) dan Content-Based (CB). Meskipun kedua metode memiliki kelebihan, mereka juga memiliki kelemahan tertentu pada masing-masing setiap metode. Secara umum pada pendekatan metode CF melaporkan kinerja yang lebih baik daripada pendekatan CB, tetapi keberhasilannya bergantung pada jumlah rating user yang mencukupi (Sparsity). Dalam situasi ini penggunaan pendekatan CB muncul sebagai alternatif. Namun demikian, pendekatan ini memiliki keterbatasannya sendiri. Misalnya, kata kunci yang digunakan untuk mewakili konten item mungkin tidak terlalu representatif. Salah satu algoritma yang sering digunakan pada metode CF ini yaitu item-based dan user-based. Item-based CF mempunyai akurasi yang lebih baik dibandingkan user-based CF. Maka solusi yang ditawarkan dengan menutupi kekurangan kedua metode pada penelitian ini dilakukanlah metode Hybrid(CB dan CF item-based). Pada CB akan dilakukan text mining untuk melakukan text prepocessing nya dan algoritma K-Means untuk melakukan clustering data karena metode ini telah dikenal sangat efisien dan diperhitungkan dalam melakukan clustering.

Collaborative Filtering (CF) adalah salah satu pendekatan yang sering digunakan dalam sistem rekomendasi. CF biasanya digunakan untuk mengatasi permasalahan sparsity. Sparsity adalah keadaan dimana terdapat banyaknya data atau nilai rating yang kosong. Pendekatan CF memiliki tiga kategori yaitu memory-based, model-based, dan hybrid. Tentunya dari beberapa kategori itu memiliki beberapa kelemahan, seperti memory-based yang memberikan akurasi yang kurang optimal ketika menggunakan dataset sparsity. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah mengatasi permasalahan sparsity menggunakan CF yang menerapkan Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) dan Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (FCM). NMF digunakan sebagai pengurangan dimensi dengan nilai optimal dimensi (optimal 'k') dan mempertahankan nilai positif. FCM digunakan sebagai pengelompokan antara pengguna aktif dengan pengguna lainnya yang berada dalam satu kelompok. Pada penelitian ini, akan menggunakan metrik evaluasi Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) yang digunakan untuk mengetahui hasil evaluasi dari pendekatan yang diusulkan. Berdasarkan skenario pengujian yang dilakukan untuk mangatasi masalah data sparsity, menghasilkan nilai NDCG@10=0,0755 atau 7,55%. Pendekatan CF yang menerapkan NMF dan FCM menunjukkan hasil yang lebih baik dibandingkan metode Item-based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF) dengan rata-rata kenaikan akurasi NDCG=31,41%, maksimal NDCG=40,17% dan minimal NDCG=20,28%.\n","https://pta.trunojoyo.ac.id/welcome/detail/170411200127\n","Penulis : GILANG ABDURRACHMAN PUTRA\n","PENERAPAN METODE TECHNIQUE FOR OTHERS PREFERENCE BY SIMILARITY TO IDEAL SOLUTION PADA PENGUKURAN KUALITAS WEBSITE E â COMMERCE\n","(Studi Kasus Universitas Trunojoyo Madura)\n","Perkembangan teknologi internet yang sangat pesat, ditandai dengan munculnya beberapa website e-commerce di Indonesia.

Pada TKCBI terdapat proses ekstraksi fitur dari citra kueri untuk mendapatkan fitur yang merepresentasikan karakteristik dari citra. Pada umumnya, TKCBI menggunakan handcrafted feature seperti warna, bentuk, tekstur citra untuk proses ekstraksi fitur. Hal ini memerlukan waktu tersendiri untuk menentukan handcrafted feature yang sesuai dengan citra di basis data. Pada penelitian ini diusulkan metode feature learning untuk mengekstraksi fitur dari citra kueri maupun citra basis data menggunakan Self Supervised Convolutional Autoencoder. Penggunaan feature learning tidak memerlukan penentuan fitur buatan tangan karena feature learning mempelajari secara langsung fitur-fitur penting dari citra basis data. Sedangkan, Self Supervised Convolutional Autoencoder digunakan untuk meningkatkan kinerja dari feature learning dalam proses pelatihan. Pada Convolutional Autoencoder terdapat dua layer, yaitu layer Encoder dan layer Decoder. Layer Encoder digunakan untuk mengurangi dimensi citra dan menentukan fitur-fitur yang paling penting dalam citra masukan. Layer Decoder digunakan untuk merekontruksi fitur-fitur yang penting hasil dari Encoder menjadi sebuah citra yang mirip citra masukan. Untuk pengukuran kemiripan citra secara umum menggunakan metode Ecludian Distance. Uji coba dilakukan untuk membandingkan akurasi TKCBI menggunakan feature learning dan TKCBI tanpa feature learning. Uji coba dilakukan pada dataset GHIM-10K Dataset dari Guangxi Normal University, China. Dari hasil uji coba yang telah dilakukan TKCBI dengan feature learning untuk dua ratus citra kueri dari dua puluh kelas menggunakan Self Supervised Convolutional Autoencoder mendapatkan nilai Average Precision yaitu 39,6%. Jumlah fitur yang diekstraksi adalah 64 fitur. Sedangkan, TKCBI tanpa menggunakan feature learning dengan jumlah citra kueri yang sama namun jumlah fiturnya adalah 64x64x3 fitur mendapatkan nilai Average Precision yaitu 41,2%. Namun, waktu retrieve yang dibutuhkan untuk mendapatkan citra dari penggunaan feature learning lebih cepat yaitu 0,2 detik daripada waktu komputasi dari TKCBI tanpa feature learning.\n","https://pta.trunojoyo.ac.id/welcome/detail/150411100086\n","Penulis : FARADILLA POERYNINGTYAS\n","SISTEM PENDUKUNG KEPUTUSAN DIAGNOSIS PENYAKIT MENGGUNAKAN METODE DEMPSTER-SHAFER\n","Penyakit merupakan suatu keadaan tidak normal dari tubuh manusia atau pikiran yang menyebabkan ketidaknyamanan.
